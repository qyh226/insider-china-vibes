      <div className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">📊 A Streamer Turned Soft Power Influencer</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">Chinese state media and scholars have recognized Speed's influence as more than just entertainment:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>According to <a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202503/1330924.shtml" className="text-china-red hover:underline">Global Times</a>, Speed is offering millions "an unfiltered, vibrant glimpse into China's culture, modernity, and beauty."</li>
          <li>Professor Li Haidong said Speed's livestreams help "reduce misconceptions" and serve as a powerful channel to showcase the real China.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-3">Speed's visit coincides with China's push to revive inbound tourism:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>China recorded <strong>27 million foreign visitors in 2024</strong>, and new <strong>visa-free policies</strong> for several countries (including much of Europe) are expected to boost those numbers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-2">Social media users echoed this sentiment:</p>
        <p className="mb-1">🔹 "This man is doing the lord's work in dispelling western propaganda."</p>
        <p className="mb-3">🔹 "China is awesome. People there are so nice, good energy, beautiful country."</p>

      <div className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🌍 Did iShowSpeed Just Bring $100M+ to China?</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">
          One viral commentary broke it down in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuawpUwZ4bw" className="text-china-red hover:underline">YouTube analysis</a>:
        </p>
        
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-china-red pl-4 italic my-5">
          If just 0.1% of Speed's 70M+ followers visit China and spend $2,000 (flight, hotel, food), that's $140 million brought into the economy.
        </blockquote>

        <p className="mb-3">Whether or not that math holds, the ripple effect is real:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>Speed's young fans could influence their families to travel.</li>
          <li>Travel trends, especially in the TikTok age, can scale fast.</li>
          <li>Viewers are seeing modern China not through a news camera, but a livestream.</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-3">As the video commentary noted:</p>
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-china-red pl-4 italic my-5">
          "Streamers are the new trendsetters. Speed didn't just stream. He made China look fun, wild, and worth seeing for yourself."

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">🔸 Final Verdict: A Meme, a Mirror, and a Movement</h2>
        <p className="mb-3">Whether you see him as chaotic good or a walking meme, iShowSpeed's China tour may have unintentionally kicked off a global shift:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
          <li>He connected cultures in a way diplomats often can't.</li>
          <li>He reshaped perceptions of China for a generation raised on content, not cable news.</li>
        </ul>
